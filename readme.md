# Graf.js (graph finance) 

Is a small light weight library using vanilla js and is meant to be extremely light weight to do the simple of tasks for graphing financial data.

It will be using HTML5 canvas and aims to maintain a responsive canvas structure with the key goal to be universal and usable in other frameworks such as *90 degrees* and *nuclear fusion* (angular, react knockout, etc...). Since this is simply ES5 it will be compatible with all recent browsers.

a minor goal is to create a fluid 60fps experience fo using this tool while also keeping the learning curve to this library very minimal.

my goal is to provide a high level api for simple cases to create an instant mapping, my other goal is to allow a simple interface to extend the underlying calculations while having the rendering engine do its job.

* this engine will be used in my next project frekt.aconyx.ca
